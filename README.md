This project applies methodologies for detecting people, faces, different methods for tracking them, counting people at entrances and exits in places such as buildings or public transport, and techniques for matching people, all of which are part of a system that allows counting people entering and exiting a place and as a result their correspondence.

Requirements to run project:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCv

To runMain App:

- Raspberry Pi
- Coral USB Accelerator
- PiCamera

To test counting/matching/obfuscation systems, test scripts are located in
“03_Implementacao/PythonAlgs/tests”.

Class and algorithm process diagrams are located in “02_Desenho” to understand the overall project architecture, as well as the project report in “\_Relatorio”.
